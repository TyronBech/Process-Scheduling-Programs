This is a repository for Process Scheduling Program, it contains algorithms about process scheduling such as
+ First Come First Serve (FCFS)
+ Shortest Job First (SJF)
+ Non-Preemtive Priority (NPP)
+ Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)
+ Preemtive Priority (PP)
+ Round Robin (RR)

These algorithms are written in C++ and uses std::vector and std::pair to manipulate the inputs and arranged them
completely based in the given algorithm.
